# Sapphire

![placeholder logo type image](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/002366/d4def6.png&text=Sapphire)

A placeholder repository for my very own programming language, for when I eventually get around to it :]

Not really sure what I want it to do, or look like, but after working on [ked](https://github.com/crnbrdrck/ked) I've gotten a hankering to start my own programming language for the fun of it! 

Join in the adventure if you want to :heart:

## Thought Dump
- Maybe a compiled language? (https://compilerbook.com/)
    - That book follows on from where the interpreter one leaves off so maybe start with an interpreted language?
    - Could use this language as an excuse to learn something like C++?
- Easy to read syntax (one of the reasons I love Python / Crystal so much)
- Maybe get a feel for the good parts of a few languages and try to add them into Sapphire without compromising on anything

These are lofty (probably too lofty for just me right now) goals but damnit I'm gonna have a good try off it!

## Language Ideas

```sapphire
const to = 'world'
let msg = 'hello, {{to}}!'

if (4 > 3) ->
  msg += ' what a great day'

def say(msg: string) =>
  println(msg)
```
idk, maybe?
