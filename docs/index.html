<p>Drizzle is my very own programming language, simultaneously developed as a language I would like to use and a never-ending source of things to learn.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>This project was originally called <em>Sapphire</em>.
I decided to make an organisation for this project as it would surely consist of multiple projects and I really enjoy having projects grouped into Organisations.</p>

<p>However, when I tried to do so, I found that <code>sapphire</code> and <code>sapphire-lang</code> were both taken in terms of names, and there were a few programming language projects named <em>Sapphire</em> on GitHub.
So I felt I needed to change the name.</p>

<p>Being a fan of Pokémon, my first thought was <em>Kyogre</em>, the legendary from Pokémon Sapphire.
From there I thought of his ability <em>Drizzle</em>, which I thought was a nice name for my language considering I also love rain, so there you go!</p>

<p>(Also I already had made stickers of the logo so I had to stick with blue and stuff >.>)</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The goals of the project are (in some particular order):</p>

<ul><li>Create a language with a nice syntax that I would like to use.</li><li>Constantly learn ways to improve the language.</li><li>Learn about the kind of work that goes into developing production grade languages.</li><li>Eventually get Drizzle to the point where it can interpret / compile itself.</li></ul>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<ul><li>Written in Crystal.</li><ul><li>Drizzle will work off of Crystal's GC.</li><li>If we decide to write the interpreter in Drizzle later, we'll then have to implement out own GC.</li></ul><li>Parser (will eventually be) generated using <a href="http://www.antlr.org/" target="_blank">ANTLR</a> for Go and translated into Crystal (like the books I'll be using).</li><li>Language will initially be interpreted, then will be compiled.</li><ul><li>When the compiled version starts, the interpreted version will be archived to a protected branch.</li></ul><li>When language is mature enough, rewrite the interpreter, and later the compiler, in Drizzle.</li></ul>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Some basic extensions that I would like to see built in to the language itself;</p>

<ul><li><code>drizzle docs</code>: Similar to how crystal generates documentation I would like to have Drizzle being able to parse code and generate doc pages</li><li><code>drizzle fmt</code>: Similar to tools like <code>gofmt</code> or <code>crystal tool format</code>, I would like it for Drizzle to have a built-in formatter (once we have a style guide in place)</li><li><code>drizzle deps</code>: When the language starts to grow, we would need to have some kind of dependency manager built in.</li><ul><li>Since the name change to <code>drizzle</code>, I'm thinking maybe calling deps <code>drops</code>?</li></ul></ul>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>Here's a basic roadmap for anyone who is interested in what's going on with this project;</p>

<ul><li>Write a basic (non-production) version of the interpreter in Crystal, using the <a href="https://interpreterbook.com" target="_blank">interpreter book</a>.</li><li>Research and learn ANTLR4 and use it to generate a better parser.</li><ul><li>ANTLR cannot generate Crystal code so instead I intend to have it generate Go code and translate it, like I am doing with the book.</li></ul><li>Once the <a href="https://compilerbook.com" target="_blank">compiler book</a> is released, go through that and turn Drizzle into a compiled language.</li><li>Get Drizzle to the point where it can replace it's Crystal interpreter.</li><li>Get Drizzle to the point where it can replace it's Crystal compiler.</li><li>Start trying to add on the extra Drizzle tools.</li><li>Keep improving stuff.</li></ul>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>This project is open to anyone who wants to learn anything about creating programming languages!</p>

<p>A goal for early stages is to keep documentation at a high enough quality that it will hopefully be easy to follow what's going on, but if not then please open an issue!</p>
